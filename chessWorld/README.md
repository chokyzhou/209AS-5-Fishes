# Search Algorithm for Chess World


## Overview:
This implements a knight's movement on a 8x8 chess game using DFS, BFS, A* and RRT. The program will output a valid path when given an initial state and a goal state.


## How to run?
```
python search.py [serach method] [initial state] [goal state] [obstacle space]
```

The program can be easily run by using command above. Additional input methods are listed below:

Search Method: DFS, BFS, Astar, rrt

Initial State: Tuple

Goal State: Tuple

Obstacle Space: List[Tuple]
